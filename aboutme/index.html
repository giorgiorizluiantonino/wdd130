    <h2>Name: Giorgio Rizlui F. Antonino</h2>
    <h3>Nickname: Olsen</h3>
    <p>Hi I am brother Giorgio Rizlui Fernandez Antonino you can call Olsen for short, the one and only son of Mr and Mrs Antonino. I am from the Philippines and I am taking a course of Web and Computer Development. I am also a first year student of our University here in the Philippines taking a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. 
        Ever since when I was young I am in love in playing sports like basketball, volleyball, biking and many more. While growing up in this world that has sorrounded with 
        a world of lots of high technologies, I am being interested to learn in the software development of technologies. I am 2 years relationship with my girlfriend and planning to be married next year in the temple.
        I am also a working student and I have a part time job a s store merchandiser. The thing that I love the most in BYU-Idaho is that they give a quality education for all the people who want to pursue a better job in the future and it also helps me to draw closer to my Savior, Jesus Christ. I am pursuing a degree in Applied Technology, specifically in software development.
        The advantages that I see in learning about careers in web design is that it keeps
        enhancing and developing creative skils. I became a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Days Saints when I was 16 years of age and staying in a covenant path for 8 years. 
        One of my favorite scripture verse is in 1 Nephi 19:9 saying, "And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught
        wherefore, they scourge him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving kindess and his long-suffering towards the children of men."
