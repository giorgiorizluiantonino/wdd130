                     Tuguegarao City. It is geographically located at the southernmost part of Region 02 and is often referred to as the 
                     gateway to vast Cagayan Valley Region. It is bounded on the north by Ifugao, in the northeast by Isabela, east by Quirino,
                    west by Benguet and south by Nueva Ecija.In view of its location within the watersheds of the Caraballo and Cordillera 
                    mountain ranges and its distinction as the major of fruits and vegetables in the region, Nueva Vizcaya is hailed as a
                     “Watershed Haven and Agro-Forestry”. Buses and public utility jeepneys ply the routes around the province. Tricycles 
                     are numerous in every town. Van/car rental services are available with rates depending on the type of vehicle used and the 
                     distance traveled.

                <p>Home of the Isinais, Nueva Vizcaya is located in the northcentral part of Luzon in Region 2. It is surrounded by notable 
                    mountain ranges such as the Sierra Madre on the east, Caraballo on the south, and Cordillera on the west. The province
                    has several principal rivers: Magat, Matuno, Marang, Sta. Fe, and Sta. Cruz. All these rivers are tributaries of the
                    Magat River which flows into the Cagayan River. The province is bounded on the north and northeast by the province of
                    Ifugao and Isabela, on the east and southeast by Qurino and Aurora, on the south by Nueva Ecija, and on the west by 
                    Benguet and Pangasinan. The province has basically an agricultural economy with commerce, trade, and industry contributing to its
                    growth and development. Among other major economic activities are farming and cattle and swine raising. Primary crops are
                    palay and corn. Minor crops are rootcrops, vegetables, and fruits. The province produces quality onions and vegetables often
                    sold in Metro Manila. Oranges and mangoes are now major crops being exported fresh to Asian countries.
