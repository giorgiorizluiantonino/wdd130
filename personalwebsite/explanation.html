                    of a travel site, tourists who have plans to visit the sightseeing sites in my province, which is Nueva Vizcaya,

                    that we can give to the enquirer's inquiries, I believe that the cost of each tourist attraction or whether we have a
                    copy of the pricing of each sightseeing attraction or tourist spots would be the one of the questions. Considering that
                    the primary focus of my website is on tourist destinations and sightseeing, it is essential that the activities that 
                    the visitor wishes to partake in are proper and suited for the various activities that our site offers. If I were a tourist,

                    provides a wide variety of interesting and enjoyable activities that a traveler would want to participate in with his
                    or her loved ones or close friends. Personally, if I were a tourist, I would make it a point to visit my website because 
                    it not only highlights the natural splendor of my region, but it also provides a wide variety of interesting and enjoyable

                <h2>Design Process </h2>
                <p>One of the things that help me the most to make this website successful is the grids in CSS,
                    which help me to organize all the elements that I want to put inside my personal website. 
                    Because of these skills that I had acquired all things follows and I’ve finished my website organize.
                    The major change in my website is the footer section, which it does not follow or similar in the footer 
                    which I created in my wireframe. The main reason is that I keep my wireframe simple and aesthetic.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>In conclusion for this project, I have a lot of things that I learned regarding the web developments because 
                    of this task. One thing that I learned is that doing this kind of project is a step-by-step process of 
                    learning new things regarding web development. You also need to stretch yourself to explore more knowledge 
                    outside the things that you learn in your module. You can’t finish this kind of project alone you need
                    the help of others idea, that is why asking for help to others is not a sign of weakness but rather it
                    is a sign of strength that you are willing to learn with them for your improvement. 
                    This kind of attitude will me to have a better unity for my future jobs or projects in the future.
                    I am very thankful for all the things that I learned in this course because it was taught to me very
                    clearly and understandable, this made me easy to understand and execute all the plans that I want to do
                    in my personal website. Despite of the late submissions because of my busy schedule and uncertain
                    happenings my professor had a big impact to me because he understands me at all costs.  He is very
                    understanding, kind, and willing to help me. I am looking forward for more learning to come on my
                    journey to finishing my bachelors degree here in BYU-I.
